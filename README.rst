behaving_cmd
============

*behaving_cmd* is a command and file additional feature set for the
`behaving_` testing framework for Behavior-Driven-Development,
similar to `Cucumber`_ or `lettuce`_. It focuses on cmd and file interactions.
*behaving_cmd* is written in Python and is based on `behave`_, and uses
 `sh`_.

 Please refer to *behave*'s excellent `documentation
 <http://pythonhosted.org/behave/>`_ for a guide on how to use it, how
 to write your custom steps and make it possible to extend *behaving*.
