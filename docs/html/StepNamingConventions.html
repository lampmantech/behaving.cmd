<h2>Step Naming Conventions</h2>

<p>These are the step naming conventions that we follow:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Always encase any pattern subsitutions in doublequotes. It allows usto identify the patterns with other tools that read feature files.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Make the step names long enough that they will be resolvable evenwhen used as a part of a large ecosystem of behaving packages.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Use "following" as the last word of a step to signal that a tablewill be following.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li>Embed the heading like <tt>|name|value|</tt> in the step to make sure theperson using the step knows what is expected.</li>
</ul>
