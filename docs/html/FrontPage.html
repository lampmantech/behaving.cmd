<p><strong>behaving.cmd</strong> is a command and file additional feature set for the<br />
<tt>behaving</tt> testing framework for Behavior-Driven-Development,<br />
similar to `Cucumber` or `lettuce`_. It focuses on command<br />
and file interactions. *behaving.cmd* is written in Python and is based<br />
on `behaving`_, which is based on `behave`_, and uses  `sh`_.</p>

<p>Please refer to *behave*'s excellent `documentation<br />
&lt;http://pythonhosted.org/behave/&gt;`_ for a guide on how to use it, how<br />
to write your custom steps and make it possible to extend *behaving*.</p>

<p>Right now, this project is just a proposal for how the `behave`_ community<br />
can create independent step libraries to work well together. It adopts<br />
the `behaving`_  Python namespace packages and layout. It has only a few steps<br />
as a proof-of-concept, but the main idea is to get the layout and packaging<br />
blessed by the BBDFL (Benevolent Behave Dictator for Life :-) to be<br />
the way forward for packaging step libraries. Then the `behave`_ community<br />
can work together without fragmentation and the havoc wrecked by entropy.</p>
